# sva playground

This is a place where I dump some learning examples I create when learning
about using SystemVerilog Assertions, Coverage, and Formal Verification.

The examples are:

 1. [safecracker](safecracker/) Let's crack a forgotten safe code using SVA
 1. [backdoor](backdoor/) Let's (dis?)prove the existance of a backdoor code
